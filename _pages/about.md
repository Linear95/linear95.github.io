Welcome to Pengyu Cheng's homepage!

I am a researcher at [Alibaba Qwen Applications Business Group](https://github.com/Qwen-Applications), leading RL training of the *Qwen Large Model Application* Team. We primarily focus on enhancing LLMs’ foundational capacity via training techniques such as RLHF, RLVR, and Agentic RL.
I am an enthusiast about LLM self-evolution via multi-agent gaming, which I believe is the most promising path to unleashing the potential of large models. 


I was previously a member of the *RL & Agent* Team at [Moonshot (Kimi) AI](https://www.moonshot.ai/), and the *Hunyuan LLM* Team at [Tencent AI Lab](https://ailab.tencent.com/ailab/en/index/). Besides, I have substantial experience in NLP fairness, text generation,  representation learning, and information theory.

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Duke University](https://ece.duke.edu/) in 2021. My Ph.D. advisor is Dr. [Lawrence Carin](http://people.ee.duke.edu/~lcarin/). I graduated with my B.S. from the Department of Mathematical Sciences at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2017.
