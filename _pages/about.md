Welcome to Pengyu Cheng's homepage!


I am a senior researcher at Tencent AI Lab, working on LLM training, AI agents, and dialogue systems. I have professional experiences in research and projects about LLM Self-play, Alignment (RLHF), Text Generation, and NLP Fairness. Besides, I worked on Bayesian and probabilistic machine learning at graduate school.


I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Electric and Computer Engineering at Duke University in 2021. My Ph.D. advisor is Dr. [Lawrence Carin](http://people.ee.duke.edu/~lcarin/). I graduated with my B.S. from the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Tsinghua University in 2017.
